* `/app/components/{page,shared}/*.tsx` - This is where all my react components live, typically they're under the page's name directory inside of `/components`, however there is also `/shared` for shared
componnents among multiple pages

* `/app/lib/server/*.server.ts` - These are module that should only be imported server side only
* `/app/lib/store/*` - this is where my redux reducers live, with the `/index.ts` being the root state.
* `/app/lib/service/*.service.ts` - this is utilitiy functions for my remix api routes, they typically just talk to my data layer (prisma)
